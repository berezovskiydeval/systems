# C++ Projects Collection

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)

A curated set of small, self‑contained **C++20** projects I built while exploring data‑structures, memory management and modern language features.

## Projects

| Project | Summary |
|---------|---------|
| **Library** | Simple C++ Libarary implemantation.
| **MyString** | Lightweight UTF‑8 string class that mirrors part of `std::string` API, featuring small‑string optimisation and copy‑on‑write.
| **MyArray** | Dynamic array template similar to `std::vector`, written from scratch to practise allocator awareness and exception‑safety.

All targets are **C++20‑compatible** and come with unit tests based on [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2).
